Wikipedia (About this soundlisten) wik-ih-PEE-dee-ə or (About this soundlisten) wik-ee-PEE-dee-ə) is a multilingual online encyclopedia created and maintained as an open collaboration project[3] by a community of volunteer editors using a wiki-based editing system.[4] It is the largest and most popular general reference work on the World Wide Web,[5][6][7] and is one of the most popular websites ranked by Alexa as of October 2019.[8] It features exclusively free content and no commercial ads, and is owned and supported by the Wikimedia Foundation, a non-profit organization funded primarily through donations.[9][10][11][12]
Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001, by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger.[13] Sanger coined its name,[14][15] as a portmanteau of "wiki" (the Hawaiian word for "quick"[16]) and "encyclopedia". Initially an English-language encyclopedia, versions in other languages were quickly developed. With at least 5,955,686 articles,[note 3] the English Wikipedia is the largest of the more than 290 Wikipedia encyclopedias. Overall, Wikipedia comprises more than 40 million articles in 301 different languages[17] and by February 2014 it had reached 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors per month.[18]
In 2005, Nature published a peer review comparing 42 hard science articles from Encyclopædia Britannica and Wikipedia and found that Wikipedia's level of accuracy approached that of Britannica,[19] although critics suggested that it might not have fared so well in a similar study of a random sampling of all articles or one focused on social science or contentious social issues.[20][21] The following year, Time magazine stated that the open-door policy of allowing anyone to edit had made Wikipedia the biggest and possibly the best encyclopedia in the world, and was a testament to the vision of Jimmy Wales.[22]
Wikipedia has been criticized for exhibiting systemic bias, for presenting a mixture of "truths, half truths, and some falsehoods",[23] and for being subject to manipulation and spin in controversial topics.[24] In addition, Wikipedia has gender bias, particularly on its English-language site, where the dominant majority of editors are male. However, Edit-a-thons have been held to encourage female editors and increase the coverage of women's topics.[25][26] Facebook announced that by 2017 it would help readers detect fake news by suggesting links to related Wikipedia articles. YouTube announced a similar plan in 2018.[27]
